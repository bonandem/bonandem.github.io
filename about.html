					<h1>Meet Bonnie.</h1>
					<p>Bonnie is a foodie at heart, traveler by trade, and Winnie the Pooh fanatic. She spends her days finding new foods around the city and traveling to different countries to learn new cultures with her friends. Her interest in art and creativity led her to study design in school, giving her the skills to help create content for the blog. Having been to 25+ cities, she wanted to share the great food and adventures she has had the opportunity to experience with others. Bonnie is also a spontaneous ball of energy that attempts to bring humor and fun to all.</p>

From a young age, Emily knew she wanted to create content, from DIYs to video production, she explored them all. Her love for art and design is what ultimately led her to a BS in Integrated Digital Media from NYU. Many years later after exploring with her other half, Emily is prepared to share her knowledge on all things food, travel, and life.</p>
